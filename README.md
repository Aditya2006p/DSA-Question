## Introduction

This repository serves as a compilation of end-term exam questions and practice problems to help B.Tech 3rd-semester students prepare for their DSA exam. The questions are structured around the core topics of the course, providing a well-rounded understanding of the subject.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Array**
   - Basic operations on arrays (insertion, deletion, searching)
   - Array manipulation problems (reverse, rotate, etc.)
   - Multi-dimensional arrays and their applications

### 2. **Linked List**
   - Single, double, and circular linked lists
   - Operations on linked lists (insertion, deletion, traversal, reversal)
   - Merging and splitting linked lists
   - Detecting cycles in a linked list

### 3. **Sorting Techniques**
   - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort
   - Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
   - Time and Space complexity analysis of sorting algorithms

### 4. **Searching Techniques**
   - Linear Search, Binary Search
   - Time complexity analysis
   - Searching in rotated sorted arrays

### 5. **Trees and Graphs**
   - Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees
   - Tree traversal techniques (Pre-order, In-order, Post-order)
   - Graph representation (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
   - Graph traversal techniques (BFS, DFS)

## Exam Questions

The repository includes a set of end-term exam questions based on the aforementioned topics, which may include:

- **Theory Questions**: Concepts and theory behind various data structures and algorithms.
- **Practical Questions**: Code-based problems that test your ability to implement and use various data structures and algorithms.
- **Problem Solving**: Questions that involve applying DSA concepts to solve real-life problems.
